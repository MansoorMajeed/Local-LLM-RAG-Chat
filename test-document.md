# Test Document

This is a test document to verify our RAG system is working correctly.

## Key Concepts

### Vector Embeddings
Vector embeddings are dense numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. They allow us to perform similarity searches across documents.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation
RAG combines information retrieval with language generation. It allows LLMs to access and reason about external knowledge sources.

## Technical Implementation

We're using:
- **Chroma** for vector storage
- **Ollama** with Qwen2.5-Embedding-4B for embeddings  
- **Unstructured** for document processing
- **MCP** for Claude Code integration
